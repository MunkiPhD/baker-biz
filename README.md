We've decided to take on a new busines venture for Baker Bakery to help them optimize how many pies they can create.

# Requirements
1. add cinnamon (optional), 1 tsp per pie. Once cinnamon is exhausted, you just make pies without it
1. They forgot to tell us that apple pies require butter! we need 6 tbsp per pie. There are 8 tbsp in a stick, and when we ask the user, they will give us the number of sticks of butter they have on hand.
1. Since it sells out every time, Barry the Baker has decided to make blueberry cobbler a staple in the shop.

The recipe is:
- 4 cups blueberries (fresh or frozen)
- 1 lemon zest
- 5 tablespoons butter
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1 cup milk
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
